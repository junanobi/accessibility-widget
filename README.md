## 📂 Folder Structure

Ensure your project follows this structure:

```text
/your-project-root
├── index.html
└── accessibility-widget
    ├── css
    │   └── a11y-style.css    # Styles & Glassmorphism UI
    └── js
        └── a11y-script.js   # Logic, state management, SVG icons
```

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Static HTML / Vanilla Project

Include the CSS file inside `<head>` and the JavaScript file before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Your Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="accessibility-widget/css/a11y-style.css">
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Your content here -->

    <script src="accessibility-widget/js/a11y-script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. Laravel / Other Frameworks

Copy the `accessibility-widget` folder into your `public` directory, then reference it using your framework’s asset helper.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('accessibility-widget/css/a11y-style.css') }}">

<script src="{{ asset('accessibility-widget/js/a11y-script.js') }}"></script>
```

This approach also works for frameworks like **CodeIgniter**, **Symfony**, or any system that serves static assets from a public directory.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the widget’s appearance to match your brand by editing the CSS variables inside:

```
accessibility-widget/css/a11y-style.css
```

Example configuration:

```css
:root {
    --a11y-primary: #2563eb;        /* Primary brand color */
    --a11y-primary-dark: #1d4ed8;  /* Dark variant */
    --a11y-bg-panel: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
    --a11y-text-main: #1e293b;
    /* Add or tweak variables as needed */
}
```

No JavaScript configuration is required — everything works out of the box.
